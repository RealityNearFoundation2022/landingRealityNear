            <h2>¿WHAT IS REALITY NEAR?</h2>
            
            <br>
            Reality Near is a metaverse that seeks to generate opportunities of development for its users in educational and economic fields, within a decentralized environment that offers the same growth opportunities for all.

            <br><br>

Reality Near will work supported by the blockchain ecosystem of the NEAR protocol. This guarantees complete security and transparency in the transactions that are going to be carried out within the metaverse. This system allows infinite content to be created in it, which can generate value, both for the creator and for the rest of the community.

            <h2>VIRTUAL WORLD</h2>
            
            The virtual city of Reality Near is called “Nuruk”. This name is based on the union of two words: “New” and “Uruk” (the first city on the face of the Earth).
            <br>
            <br>
            In Nuruk you can find countless activities to do, whether they are educational, work, entertainment, sports, among others. You will be able to attend the game of your favorite team, hire new employees for your company or get a job in one, sell your digital creations online or even teach or learn a new language.
            <br>
            <br>
            All activities in Reality Near are supported by the blockchain, which allows transactions to be transparent and recorded.
            <br>
            <br>
            Developing in this new environment only depends on your creativity and how you take advantage of the benefits that Reality Near provides.

            <h2>REAL WORLD</h2>
            
            
            In Reality Near, we have divided the real world into digital spaces, all linked to a latitude and longitude of the world. With this, you will be able to create and interact with digital elements in real life, through the Reality Near application.
            <br>
            <br>
This will allow you to be part of events, interact with advertising from your favorite brands, complete missions, and everything that the community imagines and creates. Said content will generate real value, thus obtaining a totally immersive and valuable experience.
            <br>
            <br>
You'll be able to view and interact with users creations on their virtual lands, and if you own one, you'll be able to create and share your own creation with the Reality Near community.
            <br>
            <br>
In the same application, you will have a wallet, where you will manage your Realities and NFTs, as well as your past transactions. You can also easily add friends; send and receive messages to them; and, in addition, see if they are connected or near you.

            <h2 style="color: #FFF;">Realands</h2>
            They are virtual plots in Nuruk that function just like a real-life plot of land. Within Nuruk, hundreds of thousands of realands are for sale so users can buy and sell them; and within these, the owner of the land can manage it as he wishes. You can acquire one and place in it what your imagination allows. 

        </div>
        
        <div class="tres2">
            <h2 style="color: #FFF;">Patchas</h2>
            We have divided the real world map into virtual terrains linked to a latitude and longitude, and named them “Patchas”. Within them you can develop your creativity, and the rest of the world can enjoy your creations through the Near Reality application.
            <br><br>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tres3">
            <h2 style="color: #FFF;">Links</h2>
            The links are Realands and Patchas that are linked to each other. By acquiring a Link, you are acquiring a Realand linked to a Patcha, and vice versa. This allows what you put in one to be reflected in the other, opening endless more options for users to interact in your lands. Imagination is your only limit

    <div class="textotoken">
        In Latin America, due to economic and political instability, more and more people prefer to trust crypto assets. Migrants from all countries use this method to send money to their relatives back home, since they don’t trust their local currency.
        <br>
        <br>
To make transactions possible, we have created our token called “Reality”, which is used as a means of transactions in our metaverse. With Realities you will be able to buy and sell plots, as well as NFTs or any item for sale.
        <br>
        <br>
In the app, you can manage your Realities and NFTs, as well as keep track of your transactions and transfer them to your friends who have a Near Wallet.
